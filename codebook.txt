This Codebook is based on de ‘features_info.txt’ file in this dataset:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

The file tidydataset.csv is a tall, skinny dataframe with 4 variables:
* Subject: the number of one of the 30 subjects that participated in the test.
* Activity: the name of one of the 6 activities that were part of the test: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
* Variable: 88 ‘mean’ and ‘standard deviation’ features from the original database. See below.
* Mean: the average of each original variable for eacht activity and each subject. 

The features selected for the original database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 'time' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMagnitude, tGravityAccMagnitude, tBodyAccJerkMagnitude, tBodyGyroMagnitude, tBodyGyroJerkMagnitude). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMagnitude, fBodyGyroMagnitude, fBodyGyroJerkMagnitude. (Note the 'frequency' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

MEAN: Mean value
STDEV: Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
